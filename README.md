# Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Project

## Overview

This project explores the intersection of quantum computing and neural networks, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to build and train a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) from the ground up. The QNN aims to exploit quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference to perform computations that might be intractable for classical neural networks.
